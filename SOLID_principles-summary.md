# SOLID PRINCIPLES

## Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should only have one reason to change
* Speration of Concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems


## Open-Closed Principle
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskow Substitution Principle
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

## Interface Segregation Principle
* Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
* YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it

## Dependency Inversion Principle
* High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
