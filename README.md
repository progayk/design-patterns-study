# Design Patterns

## Gamma Categorization
* Design Patterns are typically split into three categories
* Named after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors

### Creational Patterns
* Deal with the creation (construction of objects)
* Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection,etc.)
* Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

### Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
* Stress the importance of good API design

### Behavioral Patterns
* They are all different, no centred theme.
* They solve perticalar problem.
